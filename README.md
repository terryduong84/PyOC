# PyOC
This is a python interface to opencalphad (http://www.opencalphad.com/).

It is developed for oc5 based on pyopencalphad (https://github.com/dpttw/pyopencalphad)

The oc-src is the original opencalphad source which should be updated from (https://github.com/sundmanbo/opencalphad)

Note: libocpy.py, liboctqpy.f90, pyoc_utils.py, and compile_pyopencalphad.sh may have to be changed to work with new version of opencalphad

Install: simply run compile_pyopencalphad.sh. Check out info for more details.

Usage: one would generally need the .so file to import the PyOC interfaces to a python script. Check out the example in examples folder to see how to use PyOC.
