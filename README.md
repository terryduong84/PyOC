# pyoc5
This is a python interface to opencalphad (http://www.opencalphad.com/).

It is developed for oc5 based on pyopencalphad (https://github.com/dpttw/pyopencalphad).

The oc-src is the opencalphad original source which can be downloaded from opencalphad github (https://github.com/sundmanbo/opencalphad)

Note: update to libocpy.py, liboctqpy.f90, pyoc_utils.py, and compile_pyopencalphad.sh may be needed for newer version (> 5) of opencalphad
